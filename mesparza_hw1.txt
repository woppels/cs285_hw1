a. Assumed TVC corresponded to THE. Used this for second part of question 1.
	So T:T, V:H, C:E. Used V -> H & C -> E to calculate second part.
b. Let V -> H, C -> E, and E(x) = (ax + b) mod 26.
	So for V->H, this implies: E(21) = 7 and
	   for C->E, this implies: E(2) = 4. 
	So a * 21 + b ≡ 7
         -(a * 2  + b)≡ 4
	_________________
	          19a ≡ 3 mod 26. 
	Use this to solve for a: a = 7. Plug this into one of the b equations
	and we find that b = -10. 
	This gives E(x) = (7x - 10) mod 26. 
c. 
	THE TREASURE CHEST IS BURIED HERE:
	SAIL FROM SKELETON ISLAND TO THE EAST-SOUTHEAST.
	AFTER TWO DAYS, YOU WILL FIND A DESERTED ISLAND.
	CLIMB TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE ISLAND AND LOOK FOR A LARGE CLIFF TO THE NORTH.
	WALK A HUNDRED YARDS TOWARDS THE CLIFF AND STOP AT THE TALL TREE.
	WALK TEN FEET TO THE EAST, AND YOU WILL FIND A ROCK WITH AN > PAINTED ON IT.
	THE TREASURE IS BURIED ONE FOOT BELOW THE ROCK.

a. Effective length of the key is 3. The key is dependent on the first three bytes of the key
	as given by the key[i] equation for i > 2. The length of the key is this also because 
	to brute force this ciphertext, we only needed to brute force 3 bytes, not the full 16
	since we could just iterate over the 24 * 60 * 60 possibilities rather than 2^16 
	possibilities.  
b. Probability of one byte being randomly chosen: Let 1/(2^8) = X = 1/256. 
	where 8 is because of the number of bits in a byte.
	There are 48 independent bytes that can be randomly chosen: 
	giving X^48, which is (1/256)^48. 
c. Key was made at: 13:03:50. 
   Plaintext: BEGIN { Command: Shutdown; Password: 42 } END
