a. Assumed TVC corresponded to THE. Used this for second part of question 1.
	So T:T, V:H, C:E. Used V -> H & C -> E to calculate second part.
b. Let V -> H, C -> E, and E(x) = (ax + b) mod 26.
	So for V->H, this implies: E(21) = 7 and
	   for C->E, this implies: E(2) = 4. 
	So a * 21 + b ≡ 7
         -(a * 2  + b)≡ 4
	_________________
	          19a ≡ 3 mod 26. 
	Use this to solve for a: a = 7. Plug this into one of the b equations
	and we find that b = -10. 
	This gives E(x) = (7x - 10) mod 26. 
c. 
	THE TREASURE CHEST IS BURIED HERE:
	SAIL FROM SKELETON ISLAND TO THE EAST-SOUTHEAST.
	AFTER TWO DAYS, YOU WILL FIND A DESERTED ISLAND.
	CLIMB TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF THE ISLAND AND LOOK FOR A LARGE CLIFF TO THE NORTH.
	WALK A HUNDRED YARDS TOWARDS THE CLIFF AND STOP AT THE TALL TREE.
	WALK TEN FEET TO THE EAST, AND YOU WILL FIND A ROCK WITH AN > PAINTED ON IT.
	THE TREASURE IS BURIED ONE FOOT BELOW THE ROCK.

a. Effective length of the key is x in 2^x, where x is the approximate number of bits that would be 
	needed to represent the 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 possibilities for time from the first three 
	bytes of the key. So log2(86400) ≈ 17 bits will be sufficient to represent
	the seconds within a day, about 2^17. As such, the effective length of the key is 17 bits.    
b. Probability of one byte being randomly chosen: Let 1/(2^8) = X = 1/256. 
	where 8 is because of the number of bits in a byte.
	There are 48 independent bytes that can be randomly chosen: 
	giving X^48, which is (1/256)^48. Now to account for valid ascii characters,
	we must multiply X^48 by the number of "plaintext" ascii characters (eliminating
	backspaces, and other errant/nonneeded characters), which we can estimate to be about
	100 characters ([a-z],[A-Z],[0-9],etc.). Giving the probability to be 
	100/(256^8). 
c. Key was made at: 13:03:50. 
   Plaintext: BEGIN { Command: Shutdown; Password: 42 } END
